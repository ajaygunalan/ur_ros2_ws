This directory contains MATLAB implementations of filters (e.g., Linear Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter,
 Multi-Hypothesis Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, etc.) to track photoacoustic point sources across consecutive frames.
These filters solve the primary problem arising from elevation symmetry which is that a single-frame photoacoustic
point source localization system cannot distinguish between positive and negative elevation displacements of the source
from the center of the transducer.

This directory also contains other test code for various purposes including analysis of various probability
distributions.
